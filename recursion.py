# Recursion

# Finding Factorial
# Non-recursive way

"""
Factorial is a mathematical operation that multiplies a given number by all positive integers less than itself.
For example, 5! (factorial of 5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
There are two common ways to calculate a factorial: iteratively and recursively.
"""

n = 7  # We want to find the factorial of 7.
fact = 1  # Start with 1 because multiplying by 1 does not change the result.

"""
This loop will keep multiplying fact by n and then decreasing n until n becomes 0.
When n reaches 0, the loop ends, and fact contains the factorial of the original number.
"""
while n > 0:
    fact = fact * n  # Multiply current fact by n.
    n -= 1  # Decrease n by 1 to eventually reach the base case.

print(fact)  # Output the result, which is the factorial of 7.

# Recursive way

"""
The recursive approach uses the concept of a function calling itself to solve a problem.
A base case is necessary to stop the recursion and prevent infinite loops.
"""

def factorial(n):
    if n < 1:  # Base case: if n is 0 or less, return 1 because 0! = 1.
        return 1
    else:
        """
        Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
        This line calls the factorial function with n-1 until n reaches 0.
        """
        number = n * factorial(n-1)
        return number  # The recursion unwinds, multiplying the numbers in reverse order.

print(factorial(7))  # This will also print the factorial of 7.

"""
Explanation:
In recursion, each function call is stored in the call stack until the base case is reached.
After that, the stack unwinds, and the results are multiplied together.
"""

# Fibonacci Sequence
# Iterative way

"""
The Fibonacci sequence is a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
The sequence starts with 0 and 1 and proceeds as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
"""

def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1  # Start with the first two numbers in the sequence.

    """
    Loop to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.
    Each iteration moves to the next number in the sequence by updating a and b.
    """
    for x in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b  # Update a to the next number and b to the sum of the last two.

    return a  # Return the nth Fibonacci number.

print(fibonacci(500))  # This efficiently computes and prints the 500th Fibonacci number.

"""
Explanation:
The iterative approach is more efficient than the recursive one for Fibonacci, as it avoids repeated calculations.
"""

# Recursive way

"""
The recursive method is simpler but less efficient for large numbers, as it involves many repeated calculations.
"""

def fibonacci2(n):
    if n <= 1:  # Base case: return n if it is 0 or 1, as these are the first two numbers in the sequence.
        return n
    else:
        # Recursive case: return the sum of the two previous Fibonacci numbers.
        return (fibonacci2(n-1) + fibonacci2(n-2))

"""
Warning:
Calculating fibonacci2(500) is extremely inefficient and will take a long time due to the exponential growth in function calls.
Itâ€™s generally impractical to use the recursive method for large n unless optimized (e.g., with memoization).
"""
print(fibonacci2(500))  # This is not practical for large numbers due to its inefficiency.

"""
Additional Explanation:
The recursive Fibonacci function has an exponential time complexity of O(2^n) due to the redundant calculations,
whereas the iterative method has a linear time complexity of O(n), making it much more suitable for large inputs.
"""

"""
General Note:
Recursion is powerful but should be used with caution for large problems or where performance is critical.
Understanding the difference between recursion and iteration is crucial for efficient algorithm design.
